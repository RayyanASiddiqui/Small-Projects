# Small-Projects
This repository is for the small projects I've made on my own or in class, usually on a very small scale in order to learn and experiment with different techniques.
So far, it includes:
  - A terminal-based wordle replica
  - A terminal-based To-do app (used to learn about various sorting algorithms)
