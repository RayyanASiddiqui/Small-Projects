# Small-Projects
This repository is for the small projects I've made on my own or in class, usually on a smaller scale in order to learn and experiment with different techniques.
So far, it includes:
  - An original video game, Color Swipe
  - A terminal-based Wordle replica
  - A terminal-based to-do app
